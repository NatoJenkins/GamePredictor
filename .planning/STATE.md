# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-15)

**Core value:** Pre-game win/loss predictions with calibrated confidence scores that beat trivial baselines on the 2023 validation season
**Current focus:** Phase 2: Feature Engineering (COMPLETE)

## Current Position

Phase: 2 of 6 (Feature Engineering) -- COMPLETE
Plan: 2 of 2 in current phase
Status: Phase 2 complete, ready for Phase 3
Last activity: 2026-03-16 — Completed 02-02-PLAN.md (Phase 2 complete)

Progress: [██████████] 100%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 4
- Average duration: 4min
- Total execution time: 0.28 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-data-foundation | 2 | 8min | 4min |
| 02-feature-engineering | 2 | 9min | 4.5min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (4min), 01-02 (4min), 02-01 (6min), 02-02 (3min)
- Trend: stable

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 6 phases in strict linear dependency order -- no parallelization possible
- [Roadmap]: Autoresearch loop is the centerpiece of Phase 3 and requires governance setup before experiments begin
- [Phase 01]: Used nflreadpy (not archived nfl-data-py) as data source library
- [Phase 01]: Schema drift detection raises KeyError with descriptive message for missing columns
- [Phase 01]: Separated nflreadpy download into private retry-decorated functions for testability
- [Phase 01]: Chunked upsert at 5000 rows to avoid memory issues with large PBP seasons
- [Phase 02]: Per-season rolling reset via groupby(['team', 'season']) -- NFL rosters change between seasons
- [Phase 02]: Expanding window (not fixed-size) as primary rolling approach
- [Phase 02]: Ties counted as 0.5 in win rate computation
- [Phase 02]: EPA computed from pass/run plays only (EPA_PLAY_TYPES filter)
- [Phase 02]: Turnover differential via self-merge on opponent turnovers committed
- [Phase 02]: 6 leakage tests (not 5) -- added monotonic information test for expanding window correctness
- [Phase 02]: CLI defaults to dry run (--no-store) for safety

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: nfl-data-py column schema across seasons (2005-2024) needs live verification before feature engineering
- [Research]: Exact package versions should be verified on PyPI before pinning in pyproject.toml
- [Research]: Autoresearch loop agent interface (how agent is invoked, reads results, triggers revert) needs specification before Phase 3
